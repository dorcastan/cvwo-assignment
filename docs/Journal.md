# My Learning Journal

## 24 Dec 19: Entry 1

My first day starting on this project properly. Spent most of the afternoon 
trying to set things up, but managed to get something working by the end of 
the day, thankfully.

Today I learned:
1. How to use Visual Studio (how it works + some keyboard shortcuts)
2. How to debug dependency/version problems e.g. with `bundler` or `yarn` 
(basically: uninstall and install again)
3. What the different packages/dependencies are for (or got a better 
understanding of them, at least)
4. What a full back-to-front-end web app implementation looks like (following 
a tutorial, but still)

Other random stuff that got done along the way:
1. Changed from `rvm` to `rbenv` cleanly
2. Saw a bit of SQL using `postgres`
